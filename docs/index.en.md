`panel-editor` is a MapStore plugin dedicated to attribute **read** and **edit** workflows.

The plugin is **independent from other MapStore plugins**: it owns its Redux state, actions, and access rules without relying on another plugin's business logic.

This work is funded by **Géo2France**: [https://www.geo2france.fr](https://www.geo2france.fr)
