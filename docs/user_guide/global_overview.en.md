# Presentation

The `panel-editor` plugin adds a right-side panel.

## User flow

1. Enable the tool from the menu (`panel-editor`).
2. Click on the map to run identify.
3. Select the layer (if multiple responses) and the feature.
4. Read visible attributes in read mode.
5. Switch to edit mode with the pencil button.
6. Save, cancel, or delete according to permissions.

## UI behavior

- Panel title comes from `cfg.title`.
- Edit mode is displayed with a label.
- Action toolbar is fixed (outside scrolling area).
- Fields are displayed in a scrollable area.
- Feature labels in the selector use:
  - `[number] - (field_name) field_value`
  - where `field_name` is configured with `featureFieldLabel` at layer level.
